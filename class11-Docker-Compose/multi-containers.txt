A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains the commands a user could call to assemble an image 
whereas Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Docker Compose define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml.
so they can be run together in an isolated environment. 
It get an app running in one command by just running docker-compose up.
Docker compose uses the Dockerfile if one add the build command to your project’s docker-compose.yml. 
Your Docker workflow should be to build a suitable Dockerfile for each image you wish to create, 
then use compose to assemble the images using the build command.


**************************************************************
Docker Compose

save the below in docker-compose.yaml

version: "2"
services:
  webserver:
    image: nginx
    container_name: never
    hostname: cloudnloud
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/usr/share/nginx/html/
      


create data directory and inside copy data directory copy index.html

yum install docker-compose -y

docker-compose up -d 

then 

get the container IP address 
docker inspect aa8ed7d04abd

(or)

docker inspect aa8ed7d04abd | grep "IPAddress"


aa8ed7d04abd --> Container ID

and curl -i <container ipaddress>

***********************************************************



version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
	ports:
    - "80:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
